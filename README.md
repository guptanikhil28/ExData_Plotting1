## Introduction- US Household Elecric Power Consumption Analysis

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, data of "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" has been used for the analysis.

* <b>Description of dataser</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. This dataset has over 2 million rows. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.


The following descriptions of the 9 variables is mentioned below:

<ol>
<li><b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </li>
<li><b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss </li>
<li><b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </li>
<li><b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_2</b>: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_3</b>: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.</li>
</ol>

## Loading the data

* I have only used data from the dates 2007-02-01 and
2007-02-02. 

## Objective

My overall goal here was to simply examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. This incorporated the analysis of variation of Global Active Power v/s Frequency, Energy Sub-Metering v/s Time & Global Reactive Power v/s Frequency.

## Results

Results of this analysis have been exhibited graphically using the series of plots (PlotX where X is a natural number)
